# 🧠 Minecraft-GaiaBot

A Minecraft bot powered by an LLM with tool-calling capabilities (via [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/)), built in TypeScript using [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer). This bot can chat, follow players, mine, build, and intelligently respond to natural language prompts using structured tool execution.

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/minecraft-gaia-bot.git
cd minecraft-gaia-bot

# Install deps
pnpm install
```

> If you don't have `pnpm`, install it:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

---

### 2. Add environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
GAIA_API_KEY=your_gaia_key_here
```

---

### 3. Start your Minecraft server

Make sure you have a Minecraft server running on `localhost:25565` or update the connection details in `src/bot.ts`.

---

### 4. Compile and run

```bash
pnpm ts-node src/bot.ts
```

The bot will connect and announce: "Hello! I'm online and ready to help with Minecraft tasks!"

## 💬 Commands and Natural Language

Use the in-game chat (press `T`) to communicate with the bot.

### 🔧 Quick Commands (Immediate Response)

| Command                | Behavior                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `!follow me`           | Bot follows your player                 |
| `!stop`                | Bot stops all movement                  |
| `!come` / `!come here` | Bot walks to your current position      |
| `!inventory` / `!inv`  | Lists items in bot's inventory          |
| `!mine <block>`        | Mines a nearby block of specified type  |
| `!build <block>`       | Places a block of that type next to you |

---

### 🤖 Natural Language Examples (Tool-Calling)

The bot now uses **intelligent tool calling** instead of text parsing. When you speak naturally, the LLM decides which tools to use:

| Example Prompt                | Tools Used                    | Behavior                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `What can you do?`           | `respond_to_question`         | Lists capabilities            |
| `Mine some iron ore`         | `mine_block("iron")`          | Finds and mines iron ore      |
| `Follow me around`           | `follow_player("username")`   | Starts following you          |
| `Stop following me`          | `stop_movement()`             | Stops all movement            |
| `Come to me`                 | `go_to_player("username")`    | Walks to your location        |
| `What's in your inventory?`  | `check_inventory()`           | Lists all items               |
| `Place some stone blocks`    | `place_block("stone")`        | Places stone from inventory   |
| `Look around and tell me what you see` | `look_around()`    | Describes nearby environment  |

## 🛠 Architecture: Tool-Calling vs Text Parsing

### Old Approach (Text Parsing)
```javascript
// ❌ Fragile and error-prone
if (answer.includes("mine")) {
  const blockType = answer.split("mine")[1].trim().split(" ")[0];
  // Hope we parsed correctly...
}
```

### New Approach (Tool-Calling)
```javascript
// ✅ Structured and reliable
tools: [
  new DynamicTool({
    name: "mine_block",
    description: "Mine a specific type of block",
    func: async (blockType: string) => {
      // Direct function call with proper parameters
    }
  })
]
```

**Benefits:**
- **More reliable** - No more guessing what the LLM meant
- **Better error handling** - Each tool handles its own edge cases
- **Chainable actions** - LLM can use multiple tools in sequence
- **Cleaner code** - No complex string parsing logic

---

## 🔧 Available Tools

The bot has these tools available to the LLM:

1. **`mine_block(blockType)`** - Find and mine specific blocks
2. **`place_block(blockType)`** - Place blocks from inventory
3. **`follow_player(username)`** - Follow a specific player
4. **`go_to_player(username)`** - Move to a player's location
5. **`stop_movement()`** - Stop all movement and following
6. **`check_inventory()`** - List inventory contents
7. **`look_around()`** - Describe nearby blocks and players
8. **`respond_to_question(question)`** - Handle general questions

---

## 🔁 Swapping LLMs

To use a different model, edit `src/llm/index.ts`:

### For OpenAI:
```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  temperature: 0.3,
});
```

### For Anthropic:
```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const model = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  temperature: 0.3,
});
```

**Important:** Make sure your model supports tool/function calling for the agent to work properly!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Agent stopped due to max iterations"
- The LLM couldn't decide which tool to use
- Bot will fall back to a helpful default response
- Try being more specific in your requests

### TypeScript compilation errors
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
- Check that your TypeScript version supports the syntax used

### Bot can't connect to Minecraft
- Ensure your Minecraft server is running on `localhost:25565`
- Update connection details in `src/bot.ts` if needed
- Check that the bot username isn't already taken
